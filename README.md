# MusicImage

Creates fancy vinyl-like PNGs from music files

## Features
* Can "encode" mono/stereo 8-24 bit WAV files to PNG files
	* (with the exception of 16-bit stereo files)
* Can "decode" PNG files to re-create the original WAV
* Support for "deep color" PNG files to fit more samples into a single pixel

## Download
There are no releases, you'll have to build MusicImage yourself. If your Go development environment is set up properly, this should be as easy as running:

```
go get
go build
```

## Usage

To create PNGs from WAV files:

```
$ musicimage -i infile-11025hz.wav -o encoded.png
```

To recreate the WAV file from a PNG:

```
$ musicimage -i encoded.png -o outfile-decoded.wav
```

* `-s`/`--separation`: The distance between spiral turns, in pixels. *(Optional. Default: **1**)*
* `-D`/`--deep`: Treats PNGs as 64-bit PNGs to stuff more data into or read more data from a single pixel. *(Optional. Default: **1**)*
